# E-commerce_Return_Analysis_Dashboard
Interactive Excel dashboard providing insights into return patterns, product issues, and KPIs for an e-commerce business.

**Overview**
This project analyzes e-commerce return data to identify *key problems and business insights*.  
Using **Excel dashboards** , the project explores trends in return rates, customer behavior, shipment types, and payment modes to help the business reduce unnecessary returns and improve profitability.  
The dataset was taken from **Kaggle** (for practice purpose) and cleaned, visualized, and analyzed entirely in Excel.

**Tools Used**
Microsoft Excel (Dashboard & Analysis)
Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formatting
Data Cleaning & KPI Calculations

**Dataset Description**
The dataset includes:
Product Category  
Shipment Type  
Payment Method  
Order Status & Return Reason
Discount % and Days to Return  

**Source:** Public Kaggle Dataset, E-commerce Return Analysis (Practice Data)

**Current Analysis** → Problems + Solutions

**Return Rate Analysis (RRA)**

**Problem:**
Overall return rate **50.52%** half orders returned, huge loss.  
Clothing category highest (52.45%) quality or size issue.  
Next-day delivery returns high (51.09%) possible packing/quality check failure.  
Gift card payments high (51.60%) potential fraud/misuse.  
**Solution:**
Strengthen product QC (especially Clothing).  
Add strict packaging check for next-day deliveries.  
Implement fraud detection for Gift Card transactions.

**Days to Return Analysis (D2RA)**

**Problem:**
Avg return time 244.23 days (approx 8 months) extremely delayed refunds.  
Electronics & Books have longest return times.  
Express shipments show higher delays possibly longer policy window.  
Credit card returns delayed (259.73 days) refund process issue.  
**Solution:**
Shorten return policy duration (30–60 days).  
Improve refund processing, especially for credit cards.  
Offer early return incentives for express customers.

**Discount vs Return Rate %**

**Problem:**
Medium discounts (15–30%) highest returns (54–57%).  
High discounts (40–50%) also show 50%+ returns product quality or trial-buy behavior.  
**Solution:**
Perform product QC before applying discounts.  
Use targeted discounts (loyal customers only).  
Limit return policy for discounted products.

**Summary of Findings**
High overall return rate direct revenue loss.  
Clothing + Next-Day + Gift Card = most risky combinations. 
Average return time too long cash flow blockage. 
Discounts directly correlated with returns need smart discount strategy.

**Expected Impact of Solutions:**
Reduced return rate  
Improved customer satisfaction  
Faster cash recovery  
Higher profit margins
